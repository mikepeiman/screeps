# Screeps - the pure JS coding strategy game

## https://screeps.com/

These are my personal scripts. I first played in 2020, fairly intensively for a few weeks, and then a brief restart in 2021. Now in 2023 I've had another restart; I don't know how long I'll play or how deep I'll go; probably not far. I like using this game to shake the rust of my coding skills when I've had a hiatus, focusing on other work. 

I began with standard tutorial examples, and gradually began adapting some of my own approaches, based on Discord chat advice and examples, and a few other code repos I looked at. 

I have a long list of TODOs I'll probably never get to here, but probably the most important thing I could do to improve it at this point is a full rewrite from role-based functions for the creeps, to room-based logic and task-based functions, with a work queue, and more detail in determining timing and range of tasks.
