    1. Harvester: maximum work, minimum move; maybe carry, depending on type of harvesting/mining
    2. Hauler: minimum work, maximum carry, min/moderate move
    3. Salvage & repair: moderate work, moderate carry, moderate/high move
    4. Melee warrior: tough, attack, repair, move
    5. Ranged warrior: ranged attack, move
    6. Medic: tough, repair, move

    /*
    How to generate these creeps?
    Apply weighting values for what parts to prioritize, take current energy capacity as an argument, and calculate rounded number of parts, accounting for different parts costs
    This also allows an easy de facto adjustment for RCL levels, by using simple conditions on current energy capacity
    Can start with one move part on every creep, thus allowing to allocate 100% remaining to work, for example, and still have movement
    Eg.:
